## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes without affecting the main codebase.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    
```bash
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/shipping-logistics.git
```

3. **Create a New Branch:** Create a branch for your feature or bug fix. This ensures that your changes are isolated from the main codebase and makes it easier to review.

```
bash

git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

4. **Make Your Changes:** Add your changes, whether it's improving the code, adding documentation, or fixing issues. Follow the coding style used in the repository and ensure that the logic aligns with the project’s objectives    (shipping logistics rates).

5. **Commit Your Changes:** When committing, write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use the following format:

```
bash

git commit -m "Fix issue with rate calculation for heavy packages"
```

6. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes back to your forked repository on GitHub.

```
bash

git push origin feature-branch-name
```

7. **Create a Pull Request:** Open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch of the original repository. Include a description of what you've done, why it’s needed, and any relevant context for the maintainers to consider.

8. **Engage with Feedback:** If you receive feedback or questions on your PR, engage respectfully with the maintainers and address any required changes.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter any bugs or have ideas for improvements, please open an issue. When reporting an issue, provide:
* A clear and concise title.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
* Expected vs. actual behavior.
* Any relevant error messages or logs.

## Code Style
* **Code Structure:** Ensure the code is easy to follow, modular, and maintainable.
* **Naming Conventions:** Use meaningful variable and function names. Follow camelCase or snake_case, depending on the language conventions.
* **Documentation:** Update or create documentation as needed. This helps other contributors understand how to use and extend the codebase.

## Tests
